        <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.
        </p>
    
        <div class="exercise">
          <div class="label">Burpee</div>
          <p class="desc">
            Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.
          </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="exercise">
          <div class="label">Plank</div>
          <p class="desc">
            Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.
          </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="exercise">
          <div class="label">Mountain Climber</div>
          <p class="desc">
            Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).
