                    <p>
                        Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts
                        with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your
                        body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your
                        tank with the right type of fuel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but
                        rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent
                        change to your nutrition, you will see permanent change,
                        you will see big results. The key to success is a daily
                        focus on your goal.

                        Portion your meals and track your calories. There are
                        many free mobile apps available to help track your
                        activity level and calories.

                        Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead,
                        allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.

                    <p>Use the following as a guideline</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat
                        </li>
                        <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
                        <li>Fruit</li>
                        <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes,
                        and processed food. These foods are high in
                        carbohydrates.

                    <p>
                        When you shop for grocieries, shop the outside aisles
                        and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh
                        vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.
